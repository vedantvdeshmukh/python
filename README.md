# 🐍 Python Learning & DSA Practice

This repository contains my daily Python and Data Structures practice as part of my journey in **CSE (AI & ML)**.

I am building strong fundamentals in:
- Python programming
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Problem solving
- GATE CSE preparation

## 📅 Day 1 – Python Basics
Topics covered:
- Variables and data types
- int, float, complex, string, list, tuple
- User input and type casting
- Python operators:
  - Arithmetic
  - Comparison
  - Logical
  - Bitwise
  - Identity
  - Membership

### Files
- `variables_datatypes.py`
- `operators.py`

## 📅 Day 2 – Control Flow & Input Based Programs

Topics covered:
- User input using `input()`
- Type casting with `int()` and `float()`
- Arithmetic operations with user input
- String slicing (start, stop, step)
- f-strings for formatted output
- Operator precedence (`and`, `or`)
- Basic control flow using conditions
- Real-world mathematical programs

### Programs practiced
- Simple Interest Calculator
- Triangle area & perimeter using Heron’s formula
- Basic calculator using user input
- Greeting program using first and last name
- String slicing examples

### Concepts strengthened
- Converting real-world problems into Python code
- Importance of input validation
- Clean output formatting
- Logical thinking using conditions

### Files
- `area_of_triangle.py`
- `basic_arithematicop.py`
- `compund_interest.py`
- `personalized_greetings.py`
- `precedence.py`
- `simple_interest.py`

## 🎯 Goal
To become a strong problem solver and software engineer by mastering:
- Python
- DSA
- Core CS subjects

This repository will be updated **daily** as I progress.
